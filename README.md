# Path Aggregation Network
This is an implementation of [Path Aggregation Network for Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01534.pdf, "Path Aggregation Network for instance Segmentation"). The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on [mattport Mask RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) which using keras and tensorflow.

To start up with this repo, please follow up the tutorial of [Mask RCNN README.md](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/blob/master/README.md). The usage of both repos are same.

## **TODO**
- [ ] Test on benchmarks like COCO or cityscapes
